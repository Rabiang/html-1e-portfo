<h1>The Best Games According to Rabiang</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games (not) of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kenshi</h3>
<p>It's feel unique even it not 100% unique. Kenshi remind me of sci-fi atmostphere back when I was a kid.</p>
<h3>7DayToDie</h3>
<p>Even it still in Alpha, 7d2d still have more update than some games out there that "released" already.<br /> It's worth every dime already.</p>
<h3>Rayman(1995)</h3>
<p>Nostalgia, It's smooth game with smooth and groovy music.</p>
